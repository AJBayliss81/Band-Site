# Milestone project 1 - B 4 Flames - A Fictional band website.

This first milestone project for the Full Stack Web Developer course was intended to test my knowledge of both HTML5 and CSS3 by giving a brief to follow and implement using the 
aforementioned languages. This project will also strive to follow a mobile first approach to ensure the site will remain functional and engaging on a range of platforms from mobile 
devices through to desktops. 

The brief for the project gave three options for consideration, to design a portfolio website to show off to potential employers, to create a band website, or to design something of 
our own that will still enable all the module criteria to be fulfilled. As such I elected to focus on a fictional rock band and their desire to create a website that will further their 
career by bringing together fans of the band through various interactions and sharing of information.
 
## UX
 
The design of the website will consider three particular groups. Firstly the band, with their objective to increase their online presence and provide a place for fans to find as 
much information about the band and allow them to engage, both with the band themselves and other fans. 

The second group for consideration would be current fans. As they would likely already know some information about the band their primary focus would be to engage with the band and 
other fans to create a sense of community, and to find out information about tour dates, where they can find the band, and where to purchase tickets.

Finally, the last group for consideration would be new fans. These are likely to be people that have heard about the band by word of mouth, media coverage or possibly search engine results. 
As such they are likely to want to find out more information about the band and access different media to see if they would like to become more involved with the band.

With these considerations in mind it was important to plan accordingly.

- All users; were likely to rock music enthusiasts and so would expect a certain aesthetic, as such I chose a colour scheme of black, red, yellow and orange. This also tied in with the
name of the fictional band.

- All users; would want an easily navigable site that was fairly intuitive to use. I elected to tackle this with three main areas for navigation. A responsive navbar at the top of the 
page with links to the various pages of the site, that would collapse to a tripple bar button that could be clicked on mobile view to expand and show the links. The footer containing 
social media buttons with links off-site to the various platforms located at the bottom of the page. And finally, a responsive sidebar with jump links to content contained within the 
page to make finding information easy without having to scroll through the entire page.

- Current fans; would likely want to find other fans of the band to communicate with, as well as the band themselves. This led to the design of all pages having a social media footer 
at the bottom of the page to allow easy and quick access. Though the links are in place and working, as the band is fictional they only link to default social media platform pages rather 
than a unique page.

- Current fans and potential fans; are likely to want to know when they will be able to see the band live, so a tour page was created with dates and links to venues where they could 
purchase tickets. To do this I envisioned a European tour and devised a route through several countries, researching potential venues for this style of band.

- Potential fans; primary goal would be to find more information regarding the band. To this end an "About" page was created with some biographical information for each band member, as 
well as a "Media" page where they could access various images and music. To achieve this goal I found some stock photos for an image accordion, embeded a simple audio player with stock 
music, and inserted a youtube video of a rock band.

Below can be found the simple wireframe structure for the individual pages for both desktop and mobile views:



## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
